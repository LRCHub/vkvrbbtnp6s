[00:00.46] Never made it as a wise man
[00:03.12] I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
[00:06.05] Tired of living like a blind man
[00:08.83] I'm sick of sight without a sense of feeling
[00:30.83] 
[00:10.92] And this is how you remind me
[00:25.42] 
[00:17.35] This is how you remind me
[00:20.30] Of what I really am
[00:22.90] This is how you remind me
[00:26.11] Of what I really am
[00:35.61] 
[00:28.32] It's not like you to say "Sorry"
[00:31.03] I was waiting on a different story
[00:33.99] This time, I'm mistaken
[00:36.98] For handing you a heart worth breaking
[00:55.98] 
[00:39.37] And I've been wrong, I've been down
[00:42.25] Been to the bottom of every bottle
[00:44.90] These five words in my head
[00:47.73] Scream, "Are we having fun yet?"
[01:03.73] 
[00:50.64] Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
[00:56.26] Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
[01:08.26] 
[01:01.79] It's not like you didn't know that
[01:04.58] I said, "I love you," and I swear, I still do
[01:07.20] And it must have been so bad
[01:10.19] 'Cause living with me must have damn near killed you
[01:36.19] 
[01:12.86] And this is how you remind me
[01:16.64] Of what I really am
[01:18.49] This is how you remind me
[01:21.99] Of what I really am
[01:31.49] 
[01:23.93] It's not like you to say "Sorry"
[01:27.00] I was waiting on a different story
[01:29.86] This time, I'm mistaken
[01:32.79] For handing you a heart worth breaking
[01:51.79] 
[01:35.07] And I've been wrong, I've been down
[01:38.29] Been to the bottom of every bottle
[01:41.04] These five words in my head
[01:43.60] Scream, "Are we having fun yet?"
[01:59.60] 
[01:47.11] Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
[01:52.59] Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
[01:57.91] Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
[02:03.52] Yeah, yeah, yeah, no, no
[02:15.52] 
[02:19.90] Never made it as a wise man
[02:22.63] I couldn't cut it as a poor man stealing
[02:25.65] And this is how you remind me
[02:31.10] This is how you remind me
[02:43.60] 
[02:36.72] This is how you remind me
[02:39.62] Of what I really am
[02:42.55] This is how you remind me
[02:45.82] Of what I really am
[02:55.32] 
[02:47.76] It's not like you to say "Sorry"
[02:50.60] I was waiting on a different story
[02:53.49] This time I'm mistaken
[02:56.05] For handing you a heart worth breaking
[03:15.05] 
[02:58.68] And I've been wrong, I've been down
[03:01.79] Been to the bottom of every bottle
[03:04.85] These five words in my head
[03:07.54] Scream, "Are we having fun yet?"
[03:23.54] 
[03:10.84] Yeah, yeah, are we having fun yet?
[03:16.24] Yeah, yeah, are we having fun yet?
[03:21.64] Yeah, yeah, are we having fun yet?
[03:38.64] 
[03:27.38] Yeah, yeah
[03:32.38] 
[03:33.54] No, no
